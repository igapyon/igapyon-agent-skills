# igapyon-github-writer

This skill drafts Markdown text for GitHub surfaces from local repository evidence. It can also report the current branch status as preparation for GitHub writing work.

Use it only for GitHub writing text and the local branch-status checks that prepare that writing. Do not create PRs, tags, releases, issues, branches, commits, or remote changes unless the user separately asks for that operation.

Do not use this skill for generic commit summaries, changelogs, branch inspection, or repository cleanup unless the user explicitly asks for GitHub PR, GitHub Release, GitHub About text, branch status through this skill, or names this skill.

If the user asks whether there is a skill for GitHub PR, Release, or About text, mention this skill as an available option, but do not apply it until the user asks to use it.

## Mode Phrases

After this skill is active, choose the workflow mode from the user's wording. The wording does not need to exactly say `pr text` or `release text`; similar phrases are enough.

Examples:

- PR mode: `pr textつくりたい`, `PR文面を作りたい`, `pull request本文`, `プルリク説明`, `PRタイトルと本文`
- Release mode: `release textつくりたい`, `リリース文を作りたい`, `release notes`, `リリースノート`, `GitHub Release本文`
- About mode: `GitHub Aboutを書きたい`, `About文`, `リポジトリ説明`, `GitHub説明文`
- Branch Status mode: `github-writerでブランチ状況`, `今のブランチの状況`, `PR前にブランチ状態を見たい`, `現在ブランチの確認`

If the mode is clear but required evidence is missing, do not draft yet. Ask for the missing target, except for PR mode's default target rule:

- PR mode: if the user asks for PR text without specifying a commit ID, Git range, branch comparison, or working-tree target, first run `git log --oneline --decorate -1` to resolve the current latest commit, then use that single commit as the PR target. Do not include uncommitted working-tree changes.
- Release mode: ask for the start commit ID, explicit Git range, or tag/range target.
- About mode: ask whether to use `README.md` and project metadata, or ask for the source text when repository evidence is not obvious.

## Core Workflow

1. Identify whether the request is for PR, Release, About text, or Branch Status.
2. Read [references/github-writing-rules.md](references/github-writing-rules.md) before drafting.
3. Read the mode-specific reference: [references/pr-writing.md](references/pr-writing.md), [references/release-writing.md](references/release-writing.md), [references/about-writing.md](references/about-writing.md), or [references/branch-status.md](references/branch-status.md).
4. Inspect only the repository evidence needed for the requested mode.
5. Draft or report from evidence without inventing unsupported facts.
6. Return the final answer using the format required by the selected reference.

## Reference Use

Use [references/github-writing-rules.md](references/github-writing-rules.md) for shared evidence collection and hallucination-prevention rules.

Use these mode-specific references:

- [references/pr-writing.md](references/pr-writing.md) for GitHub PR title and body drafting
- [references/release-writing.md](references/release-writing.md) for GitHub Release title and body drafting
- [references/about-writing.md](references/about-writing.md) for GitHub About text drafting
- [references/branch-status.md](references/branch-status.md) for current branch status reporting before GitHub writing work

Use `index.json` as the discovery index when you need to confirm the available bundled reference files, but treat `SKILL.md` and files under `references/` as the source of truth.

Keep this `SKILL.md` lean. Put detailed commands, output shapes, and mode-specific rules under `references/`.

## Verification

Before finishing:

- ensure the final answer contains no absolute paths, home directories, or working directories
- ensure unsupported items are marked `未確認`, `要確認`, or omitted
- for PR, Release, and About modes, ensure the final answer is wrapped with `~~~~markdown` and `~~~~`
